                            take them to the city. Before they leave Luke gives Percy magical shoes that 
                            will give him the ability to fly. After giving the gift he says good bye to 
                            Annabeth and Grover. After, he leaves Percy gives Grover the shoes because Percy 
                            would not be able to fly in fear of angering Zeus.

                            Before they leave Chiron gives Percy back the pen that he used to kill. Mrs..... 
                            He learns that the pen is a gift from his father that Chiron held on to for him
                            known as Riptide(Anaklusmos). The trio are now all ready to leave for their quest.

                          Argus drops them off at a bus stop where they wait for their bus. They board the bus 
                          when it arrives. As they are settling in they notice all of the Furies enter the bus. 
                          The bus starts to move and Annabeth comes up with a plan. Percy will use Annabeth's 
                          invisibility cap to move to the front of the bus and get away. She is hoping that
                          the Furies will not notice herself and Grover in the back. Percy is able to move 
                          pass the Furies but notices that they are bothering his friends. Percy is able to 
                          crash their bus. Percy gains the attention of the Furies
