                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                       
                        <p>
                            The mist changes the three delinquents into three
                            kidnapped children, taken by Ares. They use the sob
                            story to raise money to make it to New York. The three
                            separate at the airport. Percy goes to the empire state 
                            building and the others go back to camp to tell Chiron 
                            what happened. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the empire state building, the security guard gives
                            Percy a card that gives him access to the 600th floor. 
                            At the topo he travels through Olympus to meet the gods.
                            He explains what happened and describes the dreams he 
                            had to give clues as to who could be behind the entire 
                            issue. He gives Zeus his bolt and Zeus halts all mention
                            of the individual behind the scheme. Percy believes that
                            Kronos is being awakened but leaves the issue alone.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Percy is able to have a short conversation with his 
                            father where he expresses his approval. He also tells
                            Percy that Hades returned his mother. His father tells
                            him to return home to retrieve something and make a choice.

                        </p>
                  
                        <p>
                            Percy makes it back to the apartment and is reunited with 
                            his mom. Gabe is there as welland is demanding meatloaf
                            from Sally. He moves to hit her and Percy realizes that 
                            Gabe has abused her before. Sally takes an angry Percy
                            to his room where he finds the package that he sent to 
                            Olympus. He realizes that this is part of the choice that 
                            he has to make. He offers to turn Gabe to stone but Sally 
                            convinces him not to, claiming that she must live her own
                            life. Percy agrees but not before telling Sally that he will 
                            go back to camp and make his decision to come back depending
                            on whether Gabe stays.
