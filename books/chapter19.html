                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                        <p>
                          The trio enter the land of the dead and are trying
                          to avoid the patrols that know they are in the 
                          vicinity. While traveling to Hades, Grover's shoes
                          start to take hime to a pit but Grover is able to 
                          get the shoes off before he falls in. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They make it to Hades home and end up finding
                          out that Percy had the lightning bolt the whole time.
                          Hades also tells them that his symbol of power is 
                          missing and he believes Percy took it. Percy
                          obviously knows nothing about this. To persuade 
                          Percy, Hades gives Percy an ultimatum.If he gives the bolt 
                          and the ... to him he will let his mother go and they
                          can leave alive. Percy decides that he won't save his 
                          mom and gives the three pearls to Grover, Annabeth and 
                          himself. They float up to the ocean at Santa Barbara
                          where Percy prepares to meet Ares again.

                        <p>
                            Over a game of Pinochle, he learns that Greek gods are real and are now 
                            based in America. All of this info was
                            hard for Percy to believe but I think he is convinced when he see
                            Chiron get out of his wheelchair and into his real form.
