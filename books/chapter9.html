                        <h1>I Am Offered a Quest</h1>
                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now that everyone knows who Percy's godly parent is, he his now moved to 
                            the the Poseidon cabin(Cabin 3). Finding out who is father is, is bittersweet 
                            because now everyone is avoiding him. When he thought that he was 
                            finally fitting in, everyones seems to be now scared to approach him. Especially 
                            since it seems that someone is trying to harm Percy and is able to gain access
                            to the camp to do so. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          After some time passes, Grover informs Percy that he is being summoned
                          by Mr.D. They go to the main house to find Mr.D and Chiron playing
                          pinochle with two invisible opponents. Mr.D leaves to participate in an emergency 
                          meeting with the other gods. After he leaves, Chiron discusses with Percy the turmoil
                          with the gods at the moment. Percy mentions his dreams and how he thinks that his 
                          father and uncle are fighting over something. Chiron acknowledges this and explains
                          to Percy that they are looking for a lightning bolt, Zeus's master bolt specifically.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Zeus believes that Percy took the bolt during the winter solstice while the gods
                          were meeting. Percy vehemently denies taking the bolt as he has never been to 
                          Olympus. Chiron believes he knows who has the bolt and offers Percy a quest in order
                          to retrieve it. With the deadline to get the lightning bolt being the summer 
                          solstice, Percy accepts the quest and is told to speak to the Oracle.                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Percy goes upstairs and speaks to the Oracle where she orates the prophecy. Percy 
                          repeats the first two lines to Chiron and Grover. He fails to say the last two lines 
                          because he thinks the lines mean something will go wrong on the quest. Chiron is
                          sceptical that Percy is not saying everything but does not press him for more. Chiron
                          proceeds to explain to Percy that he believes that Hades is the one behind the entire
                          schemes since he is the one with most obvious gain if his brothers fight. This means
                          that Percy has to to the Underworld.                     
                          Percy now has to find the entrance to the Underworld in Los Angeles with Grover
                          and Annabeth, who volunteered to go on the trip.

                        <h2>Dream Alert</h2>

                        <p>
                          Percy dreams about two men fighting on the beach which symbolize Zeus and 
                          Poseidon. Percy tries to stop them but is unable to do so 
                          He also dreams about a voice beckoning him to go underground. In the 
                          beginning, I thought he was dreaming about Hades but in actuallity, we will learn
                          that he is dreaming about someone else. In the end, Percy falls into a crack in
                          the earth and wakes up.
                        </p>
                        
              
                      
                        <h2>Main Takeaways</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Percy learns about the quest that he has to take
                            </li>
                            <li>Percy is conflicted about his father claiming him because it seems
                              that the reason that he did so, was for Percy to help him make up with His
                              father.
