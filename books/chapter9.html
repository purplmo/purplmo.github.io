                        <p>
                            Now that everyone knows who Percy's godly parent is, his now moved to 
                            the the Poseidon cabin. Finding out who is father is, is bittersweet 
                            because now everyone is avoiding him. When he thought that he was 
                            finally fitting in, everyones seems to be now scared to approach him.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over a game of Pinochle, he learns that Greek gods are real and are now 
                            based in America. All of this info was
                            hard for Percy to believe but I think he is convinced when he see
                            Chiron get out of his wheelchair and into his real form.
