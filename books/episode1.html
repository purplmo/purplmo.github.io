                        <p> A demigod is the offspring of a greek god and human. Also
                          known as half-blood.

                        <h2> Episode Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>
                          I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the episode. The episode basically goes through 
                        the first four chapters of the book. I really enjoyed that 
                        even though they are staying true to the book, they are makinig slight 
                        changes to help transition the series to TV. For example, the addition
                        of the scene in the office where we see how Grover lies to get 
                        him kicked out of school. It shows the audience how dangerous Grover 
                        thought Percy staying at the school was and how he was protecting him 
                        from the sidelines without Percy knowing. In the books we learn that the school 
                        informs him that he would not be allowed to return, and he finishes the year.
                         I feel to show that would of spent too much time at Yancy Academy when the 
                         story needed to progress.

                          They also added some elements that would only make sense if you read the books.
