                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                        <p>The first few lines lays the ground work for the
                            rest of the book if not the rest of the series. I do not know if 
                            you guys imagined who your Greek god parent would be but I gave
                            it some thought many times. I think part of the reason is how the 
                            book starts. Percy speaking directly to the reader gaves the air 
                            that demigods lived inside our world and that we could possibly be
                            one. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We gain some insightful background of Percy in this chapter. We learn
                            of several characteristics of Percy that we will later on know demigods
                            share. He is deemed as a troubled kid since he goes to a school that 
                            specializes in troubled kids, Yancy Academy. Due to his fighter gene
                            he tends to cause accidents on field trips. He also has dyslexia and 
                            ADHD
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sixth graders are on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum
                            of Art led by Mr. Brunner, and Mrs.Dodds. At the museum Mr. Brunner 
                            relays a story that we would later on find important. This is the 
                            story of Kronos being defeated by the gods and his remains being 
                            scattered about. This is important because Percy will later on have
                            to help in the prevention of Kronos' resurection. <!--wrong info maybe-->
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first time we see Percy's power is during his interaction with 
                            Nancy Bobofit while she is bullying Grover. Percy get angry and 
                            unknowingly shoots a stream of water at Nancy causing Percy to get
                            in trouble with Mrs.Dodds. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything hits the fan when Mrs.Dodds asks to see Percy
                            privately. Mrs.Dodds turns into one of the Furies and attacks Percy and tells him
                            to confess. We later find out she is referring to the Lightning bolt. 
                            At this point Percy has no idea what she is talking about. However 
                            with the help of Mr. Brunner and his collapsable pen, Percy makes 
                            it out unscathed. The catch, no one remembers who Mrs. Dodds is or they
                            are pretending to(**cough cough** Grover and Mr.Brunner).
