                        A scene that they added that I really enjoyed was Percy burning
                        the snacks he got from his mom. It shows how much Percy loved 
                        his mom and respected her to complete an activity usually reserved
                        for the gods. One thing that he said that hit home is that he felt 
                        that he was finally making friends. I know he meant a certain someone
                        in that statement which will make the betrayal more devastating.    
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        One thing that I realized is that they are putting more emphasis
                        on Luke in the series compared to the book. instead
                        of Chiron or Annabeth explaining the ins and outs of 
                        camp, Luke and another camper are the ones that do.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During capture the flag, Percy is idle, waiting for 
                        something to do. I have seen online some inidividuals did 
                        not like this scene, but to me it was m favorite scene. I 
                        believe some of the older fanbase needs to remember that this 
                        show is for pre-teens. In the show they will act their age.
