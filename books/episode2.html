                        <p>
                            Percy is given a tour of the camp, first by Chiron and then by Annabeth.
                            He is taken to Cabin 11 which represents Hermes, the god of 
                            travelers. At this point no one knows who his godly parent is,
                            so at this time he will stay in Cabin 11 with the "undetermineds". 
                            <i>Sidebar - I am really glad that Percy did something about this later
                            on. Knowing that you are a demigod but not knowing who your godly 
                            parent is must have caused a lot of resentment in campers. </i> He is 
                            introduced to Luke who is one of the older campers before they leave to 
                            tour the rest of the camp. 
                            Annabeth explains tells him the one thing they all share in common.
                            The campers are demigods who has made it safely to the camp. He also
                            learns why he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dyslexia: His eyes are meant to read Ancient Greek.</li>
                                <li>ADHD: Fighter's instinct causes him to see more than the average
                                    person. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A girl named Clarisse, approaches Annabeth and Percy, and immediately
                            start harassing Percy claiming it as an iniation for newcommers. 
                            Clarisse and two girls from the Ares cabin drag Percy to the bathroom
                            and try to push him into the toilet bowl. However, the plumbing has 
                            other ideas and hoses the girls down and pushes them out of the bathroom
                            and leaves Annabeth drenched in water. This causes the Ares girls to leave in a 
                            rage and Annabeth to include Percy in on her plans for Capture the Flag.

                        A scene that they added that I really enjoyed was Percy burning
                        the snacks he got from his mom. It shows how much Percy loved 
                        his mom and respected her to complete an activity usually reserved
                        for the gods.
