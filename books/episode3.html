                      <h2> Episode Thoughts</h2>
                      <p>
                        Every episode has stolen my heart so far. After 
                        rereading the corresponding chapters, it is apparent
                        that they changed certain scenes, but they are sticking
                        to the main themes of the story that the oracle mentions. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The ending is a new scene. I always wondered how the 
                        gods first reacted to Medusa's head. It was fun to see
                        a little bit of how they probably reacted. The scenes
                        that they add to the series feel like they are giving 
                        older fans new content. 
                                    
                      </p>
                      <p>One thing that I noticed was instead of Annabeth volunteering
                        for the quest she was chosen by Percy. We later learn that it is 
                        because of what the Oracle said to Percy in the prophecy. Due to
                        their previous interactions, Percy is unable to see a future
                        where he can be friends with Annabeth. I really enjoyed this 
                        change because it opened a door for the two see that they can
                        trust each other. 
                      </p>
                      <p>I am glad that they are focusing on Percy's feelings about
                        his father and his lack of interaction with him. It is important
                        for the story when we learn about the impending betrayal.
