                        <p>
                            Percy goes back to camp where he is met with a
                            celebration from the campfor the completion of the 
                            quest. He also receives a letter from his mom that 
                            insinuates that she used Medusa's head and sold the 
                            sculpture which gave her enough money to move and to 
                            start college. She also gives him the option of 
                            returning to go to a private school for 7th grade.
                                            
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Percy makes it to the end of the summer and has to 
                            decide whether he will stay year-round or live with his 
                            mom. Grover already received his searcher's license 
                            and left weeks ago and Annabeth will stay year-round. 
                            Before he makes the decision, he goes to training area 
                            to practice but finds Luke there. Luke invites him to 
                            the woods to fight a something and Percy agrees. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Percy realizes the third part of the prophecy was about
                            Luke. Luke has grown to hate the gods and was manipulated
                            by Kronos.Percy learns that Luke stole the lightening Bolt
                            and the helm. Ares found out what he did and was going to 
                            turn him in but Luke waas able to manipulate him into hiding
                            the items until another demigod could take it to Hades. That
                            demigod was Percy but their plan failed. He summons a scorpion
                            to kill Percy. Luke leaves and the scorpion attacks. Percy 
                            is able to kill it but not before he is poisoned. He is able to
                            get help and loses conciousness.

                        <p>
                            When Percy wakes up Annabeth and Chiron are there helping him
                            recover. He tells them about what Luke told him. Chiron 
                            leaves for Olympus to tell the gods and tells Percy he must 
                            decide if he will stay at camp or go. Before he decides Percy
                            sends Annabeth off. She decided to live with her family for the 
                            year. She promises to help look for Luke with Percy when she 
                            returns. Percy then decides to leave camp to try to live with
                            his mom.
