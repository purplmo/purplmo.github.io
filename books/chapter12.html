                            After the debacle, the trio decide to camp near the disaster. While sleeping in shifts,
                            Percy and Grover have a convo. At this point Grover tells Percy about the god Pan, the
                            reason why Grover wants a searcher's license. This a dangerous journey that no searcher has 
                            returned alive from in thousands of years. During the conversation, Percy realizes that
                            Grover's first mission was to escort Annabeth, Thalia, and Luke to camp. But overcame with 
                            guilt, he is unable to go into detail.

                        <p>
                            He does share his worries about the Kindly Ones. He believes that there is more to the mission
                            that they did not know. The Kindly Ones seemed to be looking for an object rather than Percy. 
                            Grover eventually convinces Percy to go to sleep and Percy has a dream. 
                        </p>

                        Annabeth wakes him up and gives him food. While Percy was asleep, Grover was able to find a pink
                        poodle,Gladiola, (Grover can speak to animals)that helps them get money for a train.
