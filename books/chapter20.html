                        <h1>We Find Out The Truth Sort Of</h1>
                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                       
                        <p>

                            The Coast Guard get them out of the water
                            where they meet Ares who explains that he 
                            is the one that caused the lightning bolt 
                            to magically appear in the backpack when 
                            Percy made it to the Underworld. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When asking Ares questions, it becomes apparent
                            that he was not the one that came up with this 
                            scheme. However, Ares denies not being the 
                            orchestrator of the whole scheme. Ares wanted 
                            Hades to kill Percy in the Underworld in order to 
                            cause a three way war. Now in order to stop Percy
                            from delivering the lightning bolt, Ares plans to
                            kill Percy. Percy makes a deal with Ares. If Percy 
                            beats Ares in battle he gets the helm and the 
                            lightning bolt. Ares agrees to the terms. 
                        </p>
                  
                        <p>
                            Percy is able to wound Ares which causes Ares to get
                            angry. He goes in for the kill, but some force stops
                            him from doing so. Ares leaves without the helm and 
                            the bolt. The Furies, who saw the entire battle agrees
                            to take the helm back to Hades and explain that Percy
                            was speaking the truth the entire time.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As they only have until the night to make it across 
                            the country, the trio are only able to travel by plane
                            which might pose as a bad idea for Percy. 
                        </p>
