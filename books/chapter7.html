                            start to talk about Olympus and contemplate why the gods are 
                            fighting. Annabeth thought Percy might know more but only knows
                            that there is a Summer Solistice deadline that should be kept. 
                            Annabeth was able to gather that someone stole something and 
                            must bring it back to the gods before the Summer Solistice. 
                            Annabeth claims that she will ask Chiron to take Percy to the 
                            Oracle to gain more info and sends him on his way.

                            a brief conversation. Percy is able to gather that Annabeth is 
                            looking for a "special" camper that will enable her to go on a 
                            quest. With that knowledge Percy heads to eat dinner with the 
                            rest of the campers. Everyone gets their food and gives piece 
                            to the fire to offer to the gods. Percy is introduced to the 
                            entirety of the camp and begins to settle in.
