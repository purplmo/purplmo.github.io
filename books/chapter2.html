                        <h1>The Old Ladies Knit the Socks of Death</h1>
                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Percy knows something is not right and he has even more 
                            questions after overhearing a conversation between Grover
                            and Mr. Brunner. Why is he in danger? What are kindly ones?
                            What deadline were they referring to. He presses Grover on 
                            the subject when they are taking the bus to Manhattan.
                            However, Grover does not provide any answers. Only with the 
                            first mention of Camp Half Blood and Grover's role as a Keeper
                            in form of a business card. 
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bus breaks down and three old ladies at a fruit stand are 
                            knitting. Percy is confused as to why Grover seems to be scared 
                            of the ladies. We know however that the old ladies are the Fates
                            and them cutting the yarn was a bad omen. 
                        </p>
