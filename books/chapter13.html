                        <p>
                             They travel for two days on the train to Denver. They learn that Percy is 
                             wanted for blowing up the bus in New York. His step father, has posted 
                             a monetary reward for any info on him. Percy tells Annabeth about his dream
                             about the man in the pit. From the description Annabeth does not believe that
                             Hades is the man in his dreams and contemplates about who it could be.  
                       </p>
                       <p>
                            Annabeth opens up about her family and feeling unwanted. She believes that her
                            father never wanted her and how it got worse when he got married and had more children. 
                            Annabeth could not take it anymore and decides to run away at seven.
                        </p>
                        <p>They stop at St. Louis where Annabeth sees the Gateway Arch and gets excited. She decided
                            to take them on a field trip since they have a three hour wait. While at the top of the 
                            Arch they Grover and Annabeth get separated from Percy. This is where Percy encounters 
                            Echidna and Chimera.
