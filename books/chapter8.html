                        <h1>We Capture a Flag</h1>
                        <h2>What Happens in the Book?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Percy is slowly fitting into the camp with the other campers.
                            He still has no idea who his godly parent could be but throughout
                            the chapter there are hints but they go unnotticed. He is good at 
                            canoeing and anytime he touches water he gets a rush of adrenaline.
                            It is not until the end of the chapter when capture the flag is over
                            that Annabeth picks up on it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During capture the flag, Percy gets chosen to be on border patrol. He is 
                            on the same team as the Athena Cabin(Team Blue) opposing the Ares Cabin
                            (Team Red). While on patrol Clarisse and her siblings try to take advantage 
                            of the fact that Percy is alone to get payback for the incident at the bathrooms. 
                            Percy is able to get the upperhand however, when he falls into the river
                            and heals. Before he can continue his counterattack the Ares siblings
                            are distracted by the fact that Luke has their flag, but they are too late 
                            and lose. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before Team Blue could celebrate their win however, a hound attacks
                            Percy. Luckily, he is saved by the other campers, but he is severely wounded.
                            Annabeth, following a hunch, tells Percy to go into the water. Miraculously,
                            his wounds start to heal and over his head a sign that he is the son
                            of Poseidon appears. 
                        </p>
